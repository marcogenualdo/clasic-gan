Training a very small Generative Adversarial Network on the MNIST dataset. Built using PyTorch.

Although I never trained the model for more than a dozen epochs, it shows some very promising resluts even when the training is run for 2-3 or three minutes on a laptop.
An example of digits generated from random samples in the latent spaces is shown below.
