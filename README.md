Training a very small Generative Adversarial Network on the MNIST dataset. Built using PyTorch.

Although I never trained the model for more than a dozen epochs, it shows some very promising resluts even when the training is run for two or three minutes on a laptop.
An example of digits generated from random samples in the latent space is shown below.
